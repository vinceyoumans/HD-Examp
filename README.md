#  HD Discussion

During meeting yesterday, I heard some items that I felt I needed to confirm
1. GoLang does not have Dynamic Libraries.   But I can discuss the cGO and the OS libraries if you really need to do something similar.
2. There was some dedate about multistage docker builds to scratch.  I tried to reproduce problem but no joy.   V02 is simple example of multistage as v03 MUX
3. I am really not feeling well, so I thought I should make some assumptions and submit this
